A simple embedded operating system implementation code

This is a do-it-yourself write a simple embedded operating system, to 51 microcontroller as an example, the whole only more than 200 lines of code, but can realize the simple embedded operating system functions, to help understand and learn the embedded operating system, such as: task switching, time slice, context switching and saving, hard real-time, soft real-time and other functions.
